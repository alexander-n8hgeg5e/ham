**Please read "Getting Started" before using this Quickstart, you will be clueless if you skip that part.**

From Getting Started, you should have HAM initialized in your PC/Phone, Also make sure you have the record of your
**Github API Key** you created in the previous chapter. Also remember your **repository** and **username** of your Github
account. You should also have your **AndroidCerts.zip** file handy. 

Community recipes of HAM is located at https://github.com/ham-community, you can request to move your own repository 
to this organization to make it a community recipe. Community recipe means it is trusted to a certain level, if you trust
the maintainer of this project then you can trust the community recipe, it will not do anything shady. **Please do remember
that a evil HAM recipe can steal your Github API Key and other files so please be safe.** Always check what the recipe does,
and confirm it by yourself.

You can get a build of a recipe by giving ```ham get``` a directory or git repository url or a github repo. You can also give
a tag or branch to use.

The **~ (tilde)** symbol represents the **ham-community** organization name and symbolizes the home when using a github 
repo as argument to ```ham get```

**Example:** ```ham get ~@gh/enchilada-los19.1``` simply points to https://github.com/ham-community/enchilada-los19.1 git repository. You may replace the **~ (tilde)** with any valid github username.

```
Recipe from Ham Community:
   ham get ~@gh/enchilada_los18.1
   ham get ~@gh/enchilada_los18.1:bleeding

Recipe from Github:
   ham get user@gh/repo:branch
   ham get antony-jr@gh/enchilada_los18.1
   ham get antony-jr@gh/ecnhilada_los18.1:dev

Recipe from Git:
   ham get https://antonyjr.in/enchilada_los181.git

Local Recipe:
   ham get ./examples/enchilada_los18.1
```

You can also mention a tag or branch with ```:branch``` with git url or with github or with community recipes.

For example, ```ham get ~@gh/enchilada-los19.1:gapps``` points to the same repo but uses the ```gapps``` branch which includes
*MindTheGapps* right into the ROM.


## Getting a Build for OnePlus 6 from Community

Did you know that you can re-lock your Bootloader with OnePlus devices, upto OnePlus 7 just like Google Pixel phones
which CalyxOS is doing. Having the bootloader unlocked is not a good thing, it's actually worse. Also LineageOS nightlies
and other ROM builders don't enable Android Verified Boot which is another security layer by Android. All these security
features are lost when you simply use a pre-built custom rom. This is not good, the reason for HAM to exists is to make
it easy to build their own Android from source without relying on others to pre-build them which will be buggy and
unreliable. Also you could re-lock bootloader on OnePlus devices when you build your own LineageOS.

See [XDA Forum post on re-locking your OnePlus 6 Device with Custom Key](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/guide-re-locking-the-bootloader-on-the-oneplus-6t-with-a-self-signed-build-of-los.4113743/). The ham recipe below exactly does what the forum
post instructs everyone, the great feature of ham is to make custom builds like this very easy. **The pkmd.bin file will be 
in the  recovery zip file which will also have the boot partition for you to use.**

The following community recipe will ask for **AndroidCerts.zip** file, **Github Username**, **Github Repo** to upload output, **Github API Key** and a **Updater URL** which you can ignore.

```
 # Currently only one recipe exists as said before,
 # This is for building LineageOS 19.1 for OnePlus 6
 # Devices. (Self Signed) (Which can be used with locked
 # bootloader.)

 # See Getting Started to initialize your Ham

 # You can't flash or use TWRP when locking bootloader,
 # only LineageOS recovery. No root for now. and Root
 # is not recommended. Gapps is build right into the ROM
 ham get ~@gh/enchilada-los19.1:gapps

 # or without gapps and with F-Droid Priv Extensions
 ham get ~@gh/enchilada-los19.1
```

That's it, now your output should be uploaded by how the recipe describes. This recipe uploads the output to a 
github repo given by the user. The repo can be private so you won't get any letter from Google for using gapps. You can
stop the ```ham get``` command after it starts tracking the remote build, don't stop it before it tracks. The build will 
run even if the client is closed. The build server will destroy itself after each build. 

The output should be in your github releases of the repo you have given during the Questions,

![Demo Releases](releases.png)

**Always run ```ham clean``` after you get your output builds just to be safe. 
Running this command will destroy all servers if found.**

## Creating Answers.json

You can give ```ham get``` a json file which has all answers to the questions asked by a ham recipe, this way you can
run ham in a CI/CD or without any user intervention. Create a simple json file with key and value pair, the key should be
the ```id``` in of the ```argument``` present in the ham recipe.

See the following example,

```
{
   "github_token": "github_pat_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx1",
   "github_user": "antony-jr",
   "github_repo": "op6-los",
   "android_certs": "/home/antonyjr/Developer/AndroidCerts.zip",
   "updater_url": ""
}
```

You can now pass this json file to avoid answering the questions yourself, questions will only be asked when you start 
a build, for tracking a build on a different computer, you only need to copy the ```~/.ham.json``` file to the other computer.

Now you can use the ```answers.json``` file like this,

```
 ham get -a answers.json ~@gh/enchilada-los19.1:gapps
```
